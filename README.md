## Overview

**build-info-go** is a Go library, which allows generating build-info for a source code project. The library is also packaged as a CLI.

Read more about build-info and build integration in Artifactory [here](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Build+Integration).

## Using build-info-go as a CLI

## Go APIs

Collecting and building build-info for your project is easier than ever using the BuildInfoService:

### Creating a New Build

To use the APIs below, you need to create a new instance of BuildInfoService and then create a new Build (or get an existing one):

```go
service := build.NewBuildInfoService()
bld, err := service.GetOrCreateBuild(buildName, buildNumber)
```

It's important to invoke this function at the very beginning of the build, so that the start time property in the build-info will be accurate.

### Generating Build-Info for Go Projects

After you [created a Build](#creating-a-new-build), you can create a new Go build-info module for your Go project and collect its dependencies:

```go
// You can pass an empty string as an argument, if the root of the Go project is the working directory
goModule, err := bld.AddGoModule(goProjectPath)
// Calculate the dependencies used by this module, and store them in the module struct.
err = goModule.CalcDependencies()
```

You can also add artifacts to that module:

```go
artifact1 := entities.Artifact{Name: "v1.0.0.mod", Type: "mod", Checksum: &entities.Checksum{Sha1: "123", Md5: "456"}}
err = goModule.AddArtifacts(artifact1, artifact2, ...)
```

### Collecting Environment Variables

Using `CollectEnv()` you can collect environment variables and attach them to the build.

After calling `ToBuildInfo()` ([see below](#get-the-complete-build-info)), you can also filter the environment variables using the `IncludeEnv()` and `ExcludeEnv()` methods of BuildInfo.

```go
err := bld.CollectEnv()
buildInfo, err := bld.ToBuildInfo()
err = buildInfo.IncludeEnv("ENV_VAR", "JFROG_CLI_*")
err = buildInfo.ExcludeEnv("*password*", "*secret*", "*token*")
```

### Get the Complete Build-Info

Using the `ToBuildInfo()` method you can create a complete BuildInfo struct with all the information collected:

```go
buildInfo, err := bld.ToBuildInfo()
err = bld.Clean()
```

### Clean the Build Cache

The process of generating build-info uses the local file system as a caching layer. This allows using this library by multiple processes.

If you finished working on a certain Build and you want to delete it from the cache, all you need to do is to call this function:

```go
err := bld.Clean()
```

## Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command from within the root directory of the project:

```sh
go test -v ./...
```
